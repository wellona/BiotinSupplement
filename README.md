# Biotin Supplement
Invest in Your Skin and Hair Because They Compliment Your Physique
Being good and healthy always doesnâ€™t symbolize healthy from inside but also from the outside. A good diet though increases our efficiency from inside but some supplements from outside are also needed for our skin, hair, and nails to keep them shining. Greatness in your skin and hair does not happen on its own; a supplement is always needed for supporting and maintaining them.

Biotin, also known as vitamin B and vitamin H, is an essential requirement in our body to convert certain nutrients into energy. It helps in promoting cell growth and also increases the metabolism of protein-building amino acids that are essential for hair and nail growth.

Clinical studies indicate that deficiencies of Biotin can cause Brittle Nails and Hair Loss. Biotin deficiency is although very rare, but taking biotin through supplements helps in strengthening brittle nails and improve hair growth.
